## What are Computer Drivers?

For your computer to work efficiently, it needs frequent maintenance and updates. One component that may need attention is a driver. How do computer drivers work? What is the best way to update them? Get the details on how these essentials keep you productive, along with how to check for driver updates and perform them manually when needed.

## What does a computer driver do?

A driver, or device driver, is a set of files that tells a piece of hardware how to function by communicating with a computer's operating system. All pieces of hardware require a driver, from your internal computer components, such as your graphics card, to your external peripherals, like a printer.

The driver files are designed to work seamlessly with the specific operating system you have on your PC, so the operating system typically keeps them updated and running through automatic updates. Updates are additional downloaded files that can install on their own to keep everything functioning correctly.

## Why is updating drivers important?

Driver updates can provide everything from new security patches, designed to keep hackers from corrupting your files, to upgrades to the technology of your device. Often, device manufacturers will identify glitches or errors, known as "bugs," then create a driver update that will correct them.

New advances are made all the time, and new errors and threats are continually identified, so driver updates help manufacturers to continue offering service to customers who buy their products. You don't usually have to purchase new components if your device is supported by driver updates.
Failure to update drivers can lead to big problems. In addition to missing out on new features or performance upgrades, your device may be susceptible to hacks or viruses or it could stop working altogether. If it’s a critical component of your computer, such as the video card or motherboard, it may leave your PC inoperable.

## How can I manually update a driver?

Occasionally, a full operating system update won’t take care of a driver issue. This is common when an individual driver update is released between major Windows 10 updates, but you don’t have to wait for an operating system update to take matters into your own hands. A manual driver update can fix issues in many instances.

_Here’s how to manually update a driver:_

* Locate the search box in the lower corner of the Windows taskbar and type “Device Manager”
* Select Device Manager, and choose your device from the list provided. You may have more than one device to choose from in each category
* Right-click on the device you wish to update. Select Update Driver
* Select Search automatically for updated driver software when prompted
* The computer will initiate the driver update and walk you through any necessary steps
